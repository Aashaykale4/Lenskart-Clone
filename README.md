# LenseKart-Clone

## Description

This project is a comprehensive attempt to replicate the dashboard functionality of the LenseKart website, a popular online retailer for eyewear. The aim is to mirror the features and user interface of the original LenseKart dashboard while ensuring that all social links within the clone redirect users to the corresponding pages on the official LenseKart website.
By cloning these features, users can interact with a simulated version of the LenseKart dashboard without leaving the cloned environment.
## Installation

To install and set up the project locally, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/Aashaykale4/Lenskart-Clone.git
    ```
## Usage
Once the project is running, open a web browser and navigate to the specified URL. You will be presented with the replicated LenseKart dashboard interface, where you can explore various features and more. Please note that any social links within the dashboard will redirect you to the corresponding pages on the official LenseKart website.
